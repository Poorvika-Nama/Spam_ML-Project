# 📧 Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques. It classifies text messages as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam) based on their content.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Clean and preprocess raw SMS data
- Extract features using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
- Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Optional: Deploy with Streamlit for an interactive web app
